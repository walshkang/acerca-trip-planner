## Goal

Reference: `AGENTS.md` and `docs/VIBE_PLAYBOOK.md`.

## Non-goals

## Decisions / Tradeoffs

## Verification
- [ ] Commands run (with expected output):
- [ ] `npm run check`
- [ ] `npm test -- --run` (for behavior changes)
- [ ] `npm run test:e2e` (required when changing planner move flows, list filtering/search, place drawer behavior, or map/list URL semantics)

## Data / Schema
- [ ] No DB changes
- [ ] Migration added (if needed)
- [ ] `npm run db:types` run (if schema changed)
- [ ] `npm run context:refresh` run (if roadmap/context changed)

## Rationale Hygiene
- [ ] Decisions / Rationale and Next Steps filled (no TODO placeholders)
