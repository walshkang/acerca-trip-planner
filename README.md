# 🗺️ AI-Assisted Contextual Itinerary Manager

A **local-first, map-centric travel planner** that turns scattered Google Maps saves into a structured, queryable, drag-and-drop itinerary.

Instead of juggling messy lists and half-remembered links, this project helps users overcome **Destination Paralysis** by organizing places into a personal database—so planning is based on *how you feel and what you want to do*, not just where things are.

This is **not** a conversational travel chatbot.
It is a **planning system** that uses AI sparingly, deterministically, and only where it adds durable value.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy: *Logic over Magic*

To keep costs low, behavior predictable, and trust high, the system follows a strict internal “constitution”:

### 1. Enrich Once, Read Forever (EORF)

When a place is added (e.g., *“Joe’s Pizza”*), it is enriched **one time** using external data sources and optional AI normalization.

That enrichment is **frozen and stored**.
All future queries, filters, and plans read only from the database.

The app never re-analyzes the same place at query time.

---

### 2. Map as Interface

The map is the source of truth.

If a place isn’t pinned on the map (or explicitly approved by the user), it does not exist in the system.
All planning, filtering, and routing operate only on this **local, user-approved dataset**.

---

### 3. Deterministic Planning

LLMs are used only to **label and normalize information**, never to calculate or decide.

* Distances, routing, and scheduling are handled by deterministic code and APIs
* The database performs all filtering and geospatial queries
* AI never performs live reasoning about places or itineraries

---

## 🧰 How We Build

- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for invariants + DoD (humans and agents).
- `docs/VIBE_PLAYBOOK.md` is the execution checklist for every task.
- `CONTEXT.md` has the current phase, blockers, and pointers.
- Use the PR template and run `npm run check` when possible.

## 📚 The Librarian Model (How Enrichment Works)

Place enrichment happens **only at ingestion time**, via a deterministic pipeline:

**Sources**

* **Google Places API** — location, coordinates, categories, hours
* **Wikipedia / Wikidata APIs** — historical context, descriptions, landmarks, structured facts

**Process**

1. Resolve the place via Places API
2. Fetch nearby Wikipedia pages via GeoSearch
3. Select the best match deterministically (distance + name similarity)
4. Pull structured data from Wikidata when available
5. *(Optional)* Use an LLM **once** to normalize fetched data into human-friendly tags (e.g., vibe, energy level)
6. Store the result permanently

After this step, **AI is no longer involved**.

---

## 🚫 Non-Goals

To prevent hallucination-driven UX and architectural drift, this project explicitly avoids:

* Real-time AI chat about places
* AI-generated recommendations without user approval
* Re-analyzing places during search or filtering
* LLM-based distance calculations or routing
* Treating external discovery results as truth without explicit user confirmation

## 🚀 Features Roadmap

Built progressively: **Cupcake → Wedding Cake**

---

### Phase 1: The Smart Repository (Current MVP) 🧁

A visual, structured database of saved places.

**Features**

* **AI-Assisted Librarian Ingestion**

  * Paste a Google Maps link or place name
  * Resolve via Places API
  * Enrich once using Places + Wikipedia/Wikidata
  * Normalize tags (e.g., *Vibe: Cozy*, *Energy: Low*)
  * Store permanently
* **Mapbox-First Interface**

  * Distinct pins for Coffee ☕, Food 🍜, Sights 📷, Shopping 🛍️
  * Map is the primary UI; list mirrors map state
* **Split View**

  * Interactive map
  * Place detail cards with factual context (Wikipedia summaries, photos)

**Current Execution Plan (Phase 0-4)**

* Phase 0 - Fix location serialization at the source (places_view + types)
* Phase 1 - Viewport logic (fitBounds + last view fallback)
* Phase 2 - Search architecture (cheap list -> heavy preview)
* Phase 3 - Preview + approval UX (preview-only Inspector, "Approve Pin")
* Phase 4 - Lists/plan persistence (lists schema + list UI)

---

### Phase 2: The Interactive Planner 🎂

Turn saved places into an actual plan.

**Features**

* **Kanban-Style Itinerary**

  * Drag places from a *Backlog* into day buckets (Friday, Saturday, etc.)
  * Backlog vs Scheduled is derived from `scheduled_date` (NULL = Backlog) and shared across Map + Kanban
  * Optimistic updates reconcile with server truth; lightweight scheduling audit timestamps
* **Deterministic Filtering**

  * Filter by category, vibe, or energy level
  * Compound AND/OR filters via filter JSON (no SQL from AI)
* **Cheap, Deterministic Time Handling**
  * “Open now” uses server time converted to place timezone
  * Timezone derived offline from lat/lng at ingestion; fallback to trip timezone

---

### Phase 3: The Optimized Router 💒

Make plans efficient and exportable.

**Features**

* **Route Optimization**

  * Deterministic ordering of a day’s activities (TSP-style optimization)
* **Live Context Awareness**

  * Weather alerts for outdoor plans
  * Travel-time badges between scheduled items
* **Export**

  * Google Maps
  * PDF / external tools (e.g., Notion)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* Next.js (React)
* Tailwind CSS

**Maps**

* Mapbox GL JS

**State & Drag-and-Drop**

* dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd

**Backend & Database**

* Supabase (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

**Data Sources**

* Google Places API
* Wikipedia & Wikidata APIs

**AI / LLMs**

* OpenAI or Google Gemini
* Used **only** for one-time enrichment normalization via Edge Functions

---

## ✨ Why This Exists

Most travel apps optimize for *recommendations*.
This project optimizes for **decision-making**.

By grounding everything in a local dataset and using AI only where its output can be frozen and trusted, it creates a planning experience that is:

* predictable
* fast
* cost-efficient
* and genuinely useful

---

## 🧪 Learning Reports

This repo generates **learning plans/reports** to capture decisions and follow-ups for the team.

- Reports live in `docs/reports` and are committed for visibility.
- Keep Decisions / Rationale and Next Steps filled (no TODO placeholders).
