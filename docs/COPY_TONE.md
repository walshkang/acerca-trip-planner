# Copy & Tone Guide (Acerca)

This guide standardizes microcopy so the product stays **trustworthy, crisp, and map-first**.

---

## Brand voice
- **Calm + precise**, never hype.
- **Truth-forward**: say what happened in the database.
- **Short verbs**: search, preview, approve, add, remove, save, clear.
- **No anthropomorphizing AI**: the system doesn’t “think” or “guess.”

---

## Core metaphors (canonical)
- **Map = truth** (approved pins are the dataset).
- **Preview = not yet saved** (ghost pin / candidate).
- **Approve = commit** (becomes canonical and reusable “forever”).
- **Lists = working sets** (they scope and organize; they don’t change truth).

---

## Vocabulary (canonical terms)

### Places
- **Place** (approved, canonical)
- **Preview** (candidate + enrichment preview)
- **Ghost pin** (the preview location on the map)
- **Approve** (commit preview to truth)
- **Remove** (delete from list / remove membership)

Avoid:
- “AI recommendation”
- “We found the best”
- “Accurate/guaranteed”

### Lists
- **List** (a named collection)
- **List item** (place membership in a list)
- **List tags** (user/list-scoped tags on list items)
- **Type** / **Category** (Food/Coffee/Sights/Shop/Activity) — do not call these “tags”

### States
- **Focused** (selected; linked across map + list + place view)
- **Dimmed** (outside current scope; still exists)

---

## Microcopy patterns

### Commit actions
- Primary: “Approve”
- Secondary: “Close”, “Clear”, “Remove”
- Avoid: “Save” when the action is actually “Approve” (state transition matters)

### Errors (factual + recoverable)
- “Couldn’t load lists. Try again.”
- “Couldn’t save tags. Try again.”
- “You’re signed out. Sign in.”

### Teaching moments (short, optional)
- “Preview isn’t saved until you approve.”
- “Tags filter within this list.”
- “Type filters change pin icons.”

---

## Empty states (recommended)

### No lists
Headline: “No lists yet.”
Body: “Create a list to group places without leaving the map.”
CTA: “Create list”

### Empty list
Headline: “This list is empty.”
Body: “Search and approve places, then add them here.”
CTA: “Search places”

### No approved places
Headline: “Your map is empty.”
Body: “Search for a place to preview it, then approve to pin it.”
CTA: “Search”

---

## Consistency tests
- Any time we show preview content, label it as “Preview”.
- Any time we commit truth, the verb is “Approve”.
- When two concepts differ (Type vs Tags), copy must keep the distinction explicit.
